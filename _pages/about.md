I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at MPI PKS working with Prof. [Frank Jülicher](https://www.pks.mpg.de/biological-physics/frank-juelicher). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. [L. Mahadevan](https://softmath.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. I obtained my PhD and Bachelor’s degree in Mechanics under the supervision of Prof. [Xi-Qiao Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Hpg2NCcAAAAJ) at Tsinghua University.

My research interests lie in the physics of active matter and biological morphogenesis, particularly in understanding how the interplay of gene expression, signals and cell and tissue mechanics generate functional morphologies. My research combines theoretical and computational tools in close collaboration with experimentalists to explore morphogenesis in multiscale biological systems. These include growth-induced surface buckling in the brain cortex, intestinal tract and tumors; phase separation in active solids; and three-dimensional chiral morphodynamics of the cell cortex. Recently, I am studying epithelial morphogenesis of the fly wing disc and the neuromechanics of peristaltic dynamics in tubular structures.
